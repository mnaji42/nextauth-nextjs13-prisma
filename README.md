# NextAuth Integration with Next.js 13

This project aims to demonstrate the integration of NextAuth.js authentication into a Next.js 13 application while utilizing the `app/api` directory of Next.js 13 instead of the traditional `pages/api` directory.

## Project Overview

In this project, we have implemented NextAuth.js for authentication within a Next.js 13 application. For this project, we implemented authentication using the Credential Provider, which necessitates a username/email and password for authentication. PostgreSQL was utilized as the database, with Prisma introduced to streamline database interactions.

### Key Features

- Integration of NextAuth.js for authentication.
- Use of the `app/api` directory structure for API routes.
- User registration functionality with Prisma and PostgreSQL.
- Protection of routes using various methods.
- Customization of session data and JWT.
